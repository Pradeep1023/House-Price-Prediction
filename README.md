# House-Price-Prediction
The goal of this project is to understand the relationship between house features and how these variables affect the house price.
Applied different machine learning algorithms on the dataset to get the best fit model.
Performed EDA on the different features with our dependent variable.
Applied 6 different algorithms i.e.,
1) Linear Regression
2) Polynomial Regression
3) Lasso Regression
4) Ridge Regression
5) Decision Tree Regressor
6) Random Forest
Polynomial Regression is best fit for this dataset as it has r squared score of train 88% and test 89%.
